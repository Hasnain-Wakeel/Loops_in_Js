--------------------------- JavaScript For Loop Practice : ----------------------------  

This repository contains practice code examples of JavaScript for loops, including different use cases, explanations, and variations.  

----------------- Topics Covered ----------------  

1. Introduction to For Loop :  
   - What is a For Loop ??  
   - Syntax and structure: initialization, condition, updation (`i c u`).  

2. Basic Loop Examples :  
   - Printing numbers with a loop.  
   - Using `+` (concatenation) vs `,` (comma) in `console.log`.  

3. Arrays with For Loop :
   - Iterating through an array.  
   - Accessing elements by index.  
   - Understanding `undefined` when accessing out-of-range indexes.  

4. Mathematical Operations in Loop : 
   - Incrementing array values.  
   - Adding all elements of an array.  
   - Adding squares of numbers and creating an expression string (e.g. `1² + 2² + 3² ...`).  

5. String-Based Loops :
   - Running a loop based on the length of a user input string.  

6. Conditional Statements inside Loops :  
   - Filtering numbers with conditions (`>=` , `<`).  
   - Printing results with `if-else`.  

7. Search Examples : 
   - Searching for a city in a predefined list.  
   - Marking student attendance by matching names.  
   - Using a flag (`true/false`) to check existence.  

8. Nested Loops :
   - Combining first and last name arrays.  
   - Matching indexes vs full nested iterations.  

Key Concepts Learned : 

- How a for loop works step by step.  
- Importance of initialization, condition, and updation.  
- Using `break` to stop a loop early.  
- Using flags to track results.  
- Difference between correct and incorrect array operations.  
- Handling edge cases (like `undefined` and `NaN`).  

Purpose : 

This repository is created as practice material for understanding "For Loops" in JavaScript. It covers simple to slightly advanced examples, making it easier to learn loops in a structured way.
